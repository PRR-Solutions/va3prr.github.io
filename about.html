		<p>
			My name is <b><i>J</i></b> (or Jay), and I'm local to EN92/EN93. <br>
			I've had at least a vague (but ever increasing) interest in radio technology for as long as I can remember. <br>
			The idea of manipulating electrical fields (something I can't directly perceive) to interact with and sense the universe in a plethora of different ways is just fascinating.<br>
			Like many radio operators, I'm a tinker with a wide range of interests and hobbies; I enjoy experimenting with Arduino and AVR microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, and various other electronic pursuits.
			I'm particularly proud of the fact that my parts bin is overwhelmingly comprised of parts reclaimed from discarded electronics, and I attempt to reuse and recycle whatever I can, whenever possible.
			With respect to radio, my primary interests are in handheld voice, the digital modes, radio control, radio direction finding, as well as antenna and radar technology. 
			<br>As a brand new ham, I've been dumbfounded by how friendly, supportive, and generous my fellow operators can be, and I hope to echo those same principles in my own operations.
			<br>My preferred pronouns are they/them, but any pronoun will do, as long as it's friendly.
