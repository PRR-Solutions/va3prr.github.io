<h4>2023-11-05 - Site online!</h4>

I've had the github pages set aside for quite a while, but haven't gotten around to posting anything
on it until just now. Functional in firefox, haven't done any testing for other browsers or devices yet.
I've been in talks with local hams to get an SSTV net started, my plan is to post received images to
this site (which means I'll have to write some styling for images and such, sigh).
