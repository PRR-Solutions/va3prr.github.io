<h4>2023-12-16 - ARISS SSTV!</h4>
<p>
  I've been a little too excited about this to remember to post about it; <b>ISS will be transmitting SSTV images from December 16-19</b>, and I'm currently preparing to try to receive the first pass over my area in just a few minutes!
  We talked about this on the net last night; ISS will be transmitting on <b>145.800 Mhz</b>, using the <b>PD120</b> SSTV mode. It takes 2 minutes to transfer an image in this mode, and there will be a 2 minute pause 
  between images, meaning that an image will be sent every 4 minutes. An ISS pass usually takes about 10 minutes, which technically means it's possible to receive up to 3 images per pass - but it's more likely you'll get one full image and two partials this way.

  Nothing for the gallery from the net last night; there were 3 of us on for about half an hour, mostly discussing the ARISS event. If any of us are successful in receiving images from this event, those will likely
  be the next additions to the gallery. I have to go finish setting up my station, will post more later on!

<h4>2023-12-10 - SSTV Crash Course</h4>
<p>
  The question I've heard most frequently lately is <i>what do I need to get started with SSTV?</i>
  <br>
  These days, if you've got a computer or smartphone and a radio, you've probably already got enough to play with SSTV. If you've got proper audio cables to connect your radio directly to the computer or smartphone,
  you'll have an even better experience, but my tests show that you can generally get on just fine without it.
  <br>
  <h5>Acoustic Coupling</h5>
  If you don't have the audio connector cable for your radio, you can use <i>acoustic coupling</i> - this just means holding your radio close enough to your phone/computer for each device to be able to hear the other.
  Whether you're connecting directly to the radio or using acoustic coupling, it's good practice to fine tune the input and output volume for each device; if your audio is too low, the receiving station may not be able to decode you, and if it's too high you'll see distortions in the image.
  <br>If you're going the acoustic coupling route, it's important to keep in mind that background noise will interfere with encoding and decoding images. You'll get the best results in a quiet environment, but SSTV 
  appears to be surprisingly tolerant of ambient noise - all of SSTV's tones fit in the 1200-2300 Hz range, so wind and road noise don't seem to disturb image encoding/decoding <i>much</i>, but voices, beeps and whistles
  will cross this frequency range and cause noticeable interference.
  <br>
  <h5>Encoding/Decoding</h5>
  Initially, this was job for hardware, but encoding and decoding images is largely done through software now (unless you're lucky enough to have an SSTV converter). There is a range of free and paid software available
  for Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS. I've had at least some experience with most of the following apps, but I mostly use QSSTV on Linux.
  <br>
  <h6>Android</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Robot 36 (Free decoder)</li>
    <li>SSTV Encoder (Free encoder)</li>
    <li>DroidSSTV (encoder/decoder, non-free)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h6>iOS</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>SSTV Slow Scan TV (encoder/decoder, non-free)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h6>Windows</h6>
<ul>
  <li>MMSSTV (encoder/decoder, free)</li>
  <li>RX-SSTV (decoder, free)</li>
</ul>
<br>
  <h6>Linux</h6>
<ul>
  <li>QSSTV (encoder/decoder, free and open-source)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Mac</h6>
<ul>
  <li>MultiMode (encoder/decoder, non-free)</li>
  <li>KD6CJI MultiScan 3B (encoder/decoder, appears free)</li>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>The fun part!</h5>
<br>Generally, the software tends to be self-explanatory, but here are some important tips:
<ul>
  <li>Many applications will allow you to stop and start the decoder while you're not receiving. In some cases, the decoder is on by default, and off by default in others. Verify that your decoder is running
  if you plan to receive an image!</li>
  <li>Check your <i>Auto-Slant</i> setting - synchronization errors can cause received images to appear slanted, turn auto-slant on to correct this</li>
  <li>Make sure you're using the correct mode! Most receiving software can automatically detect the mode being used (if it decodes the VIS code mentioned in my previous post), but nothing prevents
  you from transmitting PD240 when you were hoping for Robot 36 (4 minutes to transmit an image, rather than 36 seconds).</li>
</ul>
I'll talk about modes and my rationale for selecting Robot 36 for the net in a later post, but now it's time for a(nother) cup of coffee.

<h4>2023-12-08 - New stuff to learn!</h4>
<p>
This was a fun net, we had a total of 4 check-ins, and I think 6 images sent - check out the gallery! <br><br>
From what I've heard tonight, and from some of the images I've received, it sounds like a few of us had issues with the software properly detecting the start and stop of an image. A couple of images submitted
to the gallery were cropped from screenshots in the Robot36 android application. <br><br>
If I understand correctly, all modern SSTV encoders begin with a calibration header and a VIS code before transmitting actual image content. I suspect that the images that failed to decode properly
were a result of missing part or all of these packets. The calibration header serves as both a tuning and a timing reference; failing to properly decode this header can result in blurring, misalignment, colour smearing,
and other artefacts. Following the calibration header, the VIS (Vertical Interval Signalling) Code tells the receiver which mode will be used to transmit the image. I'm not sure if failure to decode the VIS
code will cause failure to decode an image in all cases, but it is a part of the initial signalling process. <br><br>
Since these packets both happen at the very beginning of the transmission, I think it's possible there's a combination of three scenarios causing our failures to decode. Scenario 1 is just the nature of simplex; sometimes you miss stuff.
Scenario 2 has the PTT being triggered late, missing the header and VIS code on transmit. Scenario 3 has the operator hearing the SSTV tones and triggering the receiver late. 
<br><br>

In the case of the image I sent (shown above), you can see how the loss of sync causes misalignment of colours; the background of this image is originally white, but you can see vertical blocks of white, yellow, and blue in the received version.
Explaining why this happens is a little further ahead than I've been able to learn so far, but my understanding indicates it's an issue with loss of sync. Definitely a topic for discussion later on down the road.
<br><br>
As it stands, I'm still working with Friday nights, pending feedback on a better day and time. We'll meet again next <b>Friday, December 15th</b> at <b>7pm</b> on <b>VE3OME / 146.46 MHz</b>.   
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>2023-12-02 - Success!</h4>

<p>
My expectactions for last night weren't astronomically high, but <b>wow</b> did we surpass them; we had a total of 8 check-ins, and our net lasted about 90 minutes. I'm really pleased that everybody had a chance to try sending and receiving images, and to try to work out any software issues, even if not everybody was able to make simplex contact - that just gives us goals for next time! I wasn't able to get any images out, and only copied a partial image (see the Gallery), but I'm encouraged to try again. 
<br><br>
Now that we've got a little bit of practical experience, I think our next net will talk a little bit about where SSTV comes from, and roughly how it works. I've been asked to put together a presentation for February's LARC meeting, I'll be discussing our net adventures and showcasing some of our results - with this in mind, I invite anyone who receives an image on the net to send their results to me via email along with any information they want to share about their setup and experience.
<br><br>
In the meantime, I'm working on improving my own setup; last night, I used a UV-5R connected to a magmount whip, which sat on a cookie sheet about a foot off of the ground. I've got the materials and plan to build a roll-up slim jim antenna that I ought to be able to hang in a tree, I just haven't had a chance to work on it yet. As we've seen, 5W doesn't seem to get us very far, but it can be heard around the noise floor - some antenna height and gain might help improve our results.
<br><br>
Our next net will be Friday, December 8th at 7pm on VE3OME / 146.46 MHz. I've heard that Friday doesn't work for everyone, one suggestion was Mondays at the same time, just before the LARC net on the same repeater. I'm open to adjusting the day and time to accommodate everyone who wants to play, I just need to know what works best for everyone.

<h4>2023-12-01 - Inaugural SSTV Net!</h4>

<p>
If you're within range of the VE3OME repeater, we'll be having a discussion about SSTV tonight at 7pm EST!
The net is open to all operators, regardless of experience or interest level. 
<br><br>
We'll have a round or two of discussion on the repeater so that everyone has a chance to make contact and ask any questions, 
and then we'll QSY to <b>146.46 MHz</b> FM simplex for any image transmission. 
<br><br>
You can find a list of applications to encode and decode SSTV signals <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Slow-Scan_Television_(SSTV)#Decoding_Software" target="_new">here</a>. 
There is also quite a lot of useful information about SSTV in general on the same page.
<br><br>
It doesn't take much to get started with SSTV - I don't have any cables to connect my computer to my radio, so I hold the radio mic up to the computer speaker and press <i>transmit</i>. This usually works just fine, but too much background noise will cause artefacts in the image.
