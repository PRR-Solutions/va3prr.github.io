<h4>2023-11-05 - Site online!</h4>

I've had the github pages set aside for quite a while, but haven't gotten around to posting anything
on it until just now. Functional in firefox, haven't done any testing for other browsers or devices yet.
I've been in talks with local hams to get an SSTV net started, my plan is to post received images to
this site (which means I'll have to write some styling for images and such, sigh). 


<h4>2023-11-21 - SSTV Gallery!</h4>

Added a Gallery page (see the navbar above!) to showcase images received by SSTV, as well as some minor 
modifications to the style for enhanced readability (I hope). Seems like local interest in an SSTV net
is not insignificant, so I'm hoping to get started on Friday, December 1st, 2023 @ 7pm. <b>146.46 MHz FM Simplex.</b>
