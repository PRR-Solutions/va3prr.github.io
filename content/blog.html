<h4>2023-12-08 - New stuff to learn!</h4>
<p>
This was a fun net, we had a total of 4 check-ins, and I think 6 images sent - check out the gallery! <br><br>
From what I've heard tonight, and from some of the images I've received, it sounds like a few of us had issues with the software properly detecting the start and stop of an image. A couple of images submitted
to the gallery were cropped from screenshots in the Robot36 android application. <br><br>
If I understand correctly, all modern SSTV encoders begin with a calibration header and a VIS code before transmitting actual image content. I suspect that the images that failed to decode properly
were a result of missing part or all of these packets. The calibration header serves as both a tuning and a timing reference; failing to properly decode this header can result in blurring, misalignment, colour smearing,
and other artefacts. Following the calibration header, the VIS (Vertical Interval Signalling) Code tells the receiver which mode will be used to transmit the image. I'm not sure if failure to decode the VIS
code will cause failure to decode an image in all cases, but it is a part of the initial signalling process. <br><br>
Since these packets both happen at the very beginning of the transmission, I think it's possible there's a combination of three scenarios causing our failures to decode. Scenario 1 is just the nature of simplex; sometimes you miss stuff.
Scenario 2 has the PTT being triggered late, missing the header and VIS code on transmit. Scenario 3 has the operator hearing the SSTV tones and triggering the receiver late.

In the case of the image I sent (shown above), you can see how the loss of sync causes misalignment of colours; the background of this image is originally white, but you can see vertical blocks of white, yellow, and blue in the received version.
Explaining why this happens is a little further ahead than I've been able to learn so far, but my understanding indicates it's an issue with loss of sync. Definitely a topic for discussion later on down the road.

As it stands, I'm still working with Friday nights, pending feedback on a better day and time. We'll meet again next <b>Friday, December 15th</b> at <b>7pm</b> on <b>VE3OME / 146.46 MHz</b>.

<h4>2023-12-02 - Success!</h4>

<p>
My expectactions for last night weren't astronomically high, but <b>wow</b> did we surpass them; we had a total of 8 check-ins, and our net lasted about 90 minutes. I'm really pleased that everybody had a chance to try sending and receiving images, and to try to work out any software issues, even if not everybody was able to make simplex contact - that just gives us goals for next time! I wasn't able to get any images out, and only copied a partial image (see the Gallery), but I'm encouraged to try again. 
<br><br>
Now that we've got a little bit of practical experience, I think our next net will talk a little bit about where SSTV comes from, and roughly how it works. I've been asked to put together a presentation for February's LARC meeting, I'll be discussing our net adventures and showcasing some of our results - with this in mind, I invite anyone who receives an image on the net to send their results to me via email along with any information they want to share about their setup and experience.
<br><br>
In the meantime, I'm working on improving my own setup; last night, I used a UV-5R connected to a magmount whip, which sat on a cookie sheet about a foot off of the ground. I've got the materials and plan to build a roll-up slim jim antenna that I ought to be able to hang in a tree, I just haven't had a chance to work on it yet. As we've seen, 5W doesn't seem to get us very far, but it can be heard around the noise floor - some antenna height and gain might help improve our results.
<br><br>
Our next net will be Friday, December 8th at 7pm on VE3OME / 146.46 MHz. I've heard that Friday doesn't work for everyone, one suggestion was Mondays at the same time, just before the LARC net on the same repeater. I'm open to adjusting the day and time to accommodate everyone who wants to play, I just need to know what works best for everyone.

<h4>2023-12-01 - Inaugural SSTV Net!</h4>

<p>
If you're within range of the VE3OME repeater, we'll be having a discussion about SSTV tonight at 7pm EST!
The net is open to all operators, regardless of experience or interest level. 
<br><br>
We'll have a round or two of discussion on the repeater so that everyone has a chance to make contact and ask any questions, 
and then we'll QSY to <b>146.46 MHz</b> FM simplex for any image transmission. 
<br><br>
You can find a list of applications to encode and decode SSTV signals <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Slow-Scan_Television_(SSTV)#Decoding_Software" target="_new">here</a>. 
There is also quite a lot of useful information about SSTV in general on the same page.
<br><br>
It doesn't take much to get started with SSTV - I don't have any cables to connect my computer to my radio, so I hold the radio mic up to the computer speaker and press <i>transmit</i>. This usually works just fine, but too much background noise will cause artefacts in the image.
