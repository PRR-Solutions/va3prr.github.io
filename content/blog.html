<h4>2023-12-01 - Inaugural SSTV Net!</h4>

<p>
If you're within range of the VE3OME repeater, we'll be having a discussion about SSTV tonight at 7pm EST!
The net is open to all operators, regardless of experience or interest level. 
<br><br>
We'll have a round or two of discussion on the repeater so that everyone has a chance to make contact and ask any questions, 
and then we'll QSY to <b>146.46 MHz</b> FM simplex for any image transmission. 
<br><br>
You can find a list of applications to encode and decode SSTV signals <a href="https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Slow-Scan_Television_(SSTV)#Decoding_Software" target="_new">here</a>. 
There is also quite a lot of useful information about SSTV in general on the same page.
<br><br>
It doesn't take much to get started with SSTV - I don't have any cables to connect my computer to my radio, so I hold the radio mic up to the computer speaker and press <i>transmit</i>. This usually works just fine, but too much background noise will cause artefacts in the image.
