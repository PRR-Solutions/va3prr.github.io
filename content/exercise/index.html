<h1>Monthly Simplex Exercises on 146.46</h1>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
  Line-of-sight bands really fascinate me. Of course, I've heard long-time hams say they don't understand why a person would waste the effort getting their license just to play around on VHF, and sure - I can kind of see why they might think that way.
  VHF bands and above <i>are</i> pretty limited, in some ways - can I reliably call to Europe using only RF? Maybe not - but it's limitations like those that force us to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions. I might not be able to 
  call Europe on a <b>purely</b> RF link, but I have indeed spoken to Europe from my handheld on more than one occasion using repeaters and various internet bridges like IRLP, Echolink, and DMR. You might say that using the internet is cheating,
  I say it's entirely in the spirit of ham radio; a large part of our heritage has <i>always</i> been experimentation and innovation, and we all benefit when people bring outside skillsets to the world of amateur radio. 
  <b>The only wrong way to be a ham is to be discouraging.</b>

  With that in mind, my goal with these exercises is to <b>emphasize</b> those limitations to encourage people to think about how to work around them. Sure, we can use repeaters and high power transceivers and great antenna masts to push our signals
  as far as they can go, but we can't count on any of these things in an EMCOMM event. Sometimes, we have to do the best with what we have on hand - and sometimes that's just a 5 watt handheld with a rubber duck antenna. Learning to
