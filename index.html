		To offset some of the good I try to do in the world, I've written this site to be entirely dependent on javascript. 		
		If you're seeing this message, something probably went wrong or javascript isn't enabled in your browser.
		Either that or you're lookin' at my source bro - which is cool. Shared knowledge brings us all forward.
		[my callsign] at [gmail.com] if you have questions, comments, concerns. 73!

		<font size="4">I'm a licensed amateur radio operator, holding a Canadian basic qualification with honours.
		I was assigned this call sign on 2021-12-12, barely more than a few hours after passing my exam. I'm a member
		of the <a href="http://larc.ca/">London Amateur Radio Club</a>, hoping to be a more active member in 2022 (now that I have that license).
<br><br><br>
		Inside the site, you'll find my various random musings about radio technology, being a new ham, cats, microcontrollers,
		probably more cats, coffee and whatever else ends up seeming relevant.
<br><br><br>
		Friendly questions and comments may be addressed to [my callsign] at [gmail.com], unfriendly questions and comments
		may be addressed literally anywhere else.
<br><br><br>
		For at least the last week of 2021, I'll be monitoring VE3MGI periodically, if you happen to be in the area.
<br><br><br>
		Good health and good spirits ^_^
