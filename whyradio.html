<font size=5>Why Radio?</font>

  <font size=4>
    <p>
      I've had at least a few friends ask why I find radio so interesting, now, in 2021. 
      <br>
      <i>"And besides, it's just people talking."</i>
      <br><br>
      To start with the easiest, and primary reason, <b>radio is super cool.</b> 
      I am <i>insatiably</i> curious about the technology itself, and the hobby has infinite facets to get lost in. If you want a hobby where you can learn something new every day, or spend 50 years specializing in just one or a few aspects, look no further than radio!

      If you think radio is ancient technology in 2021, there is a whole world you're not aware of; virtually every electronic aspect of our
      lives tends to be either directly or indirectly dependent on radio. The obvious and easy ones are your cell phone and wifi.
      Cell phones require radio towers to operate, that's actually where they get their names: towers are arranged so that 
      service is available within cells, to create a <i>cellular telephone network.</i> Your wifi router is a tiny little radio station.
      Your bluetooth speaker? Radio station. Internet controlled devices? Radio stations. These are all examples of more or less the
      same applications, but radio technology goes so far beyond that.
      
      Television standards were developed for transmission over radio, and many aspects of your television service are still influenced by
      or directly use radio technology - without even mentioning satellite TV. I'm only just old enough to remember having an 
      aerial on the roof and a tuner dial in the living room next to the TV, and even a portable set or two with bunny ear antennas.
      Even digital cable television depends on principles developed for radio, with your digital converter receivng and 
      <i>demodulating</i> a radio frequency signal into a digital bitstream, and then into an audiovisual stream.

      There are tons of <i>conventional</i> ways to use radio technology that you're probably at least vaguely aware of, but also
      at least several that might surprise you. 
      <ul>
      <li>Aircraft use several radio technologies to communicate, navigate and coordinate:
        <ul>
          <li> Air traffic control uses primary radar to reflect radio waves off of aircraft within a certain radius, which gives a bearing and a rough estimate of distance from ATC.</li>
          <li> Secondary radar uses a two-way radio linkup on a dedicated <i>transponder</i> which allows ATC to query flight data
            such as callsign, altitude, whether the craft is military or commercial, or even if the flight is in some kind of distress.</li>
          <li>On the aircraft itself:
