<h4>My license came in the mail today!</h4>

  I'm not sure if it's obvious from the smile on my face, but I'm riding fairly high at the moment.
  At some point, I'll stop babbling to my friends <i>about</i> radio - mostly so that I can start 
  babbling to my new friends <i>on</i> the radio.
  
  Now that I've got a paper copy of my license, I'm waiting for validation from EarthLink, and looking
  for various other ways to extend my handheld's range beyond EN92/EN93. If you've got experience
  with EarthLink (or anything related to IRLP) and you hear me on the air, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
  
  Speaking of getting on the air, VA3DWL and I are eagerly awaiting that <b>OUT FOR DELIVERY</b> message!
  If I weren't almost emitting my own RFI out of excitement, I'd almost think he's more excited than me...
  
  I'm really marvelling at the fact that this is the first hobby in which, not only have I not encountered a single
  gatekeeper, literally every person I've met just wants you to have fun and learn new things.

  I can absolutely do that.

<h4>I'm on the air!</h4>

<p>
First off, I mentioned "Earthlink" in my first post - experienced operators probably understand that I meant "Echolink..." Either way, I'm eager to check it out.
    
    As of 2021-12-18, I am now the proud owner of a Baofeng UV-5R handheld radio, which I used to check into the local daily JO net on 2m and meet a bunch of people!
Still getting over the mic fright a little bit; I'm not usually a big talker in person, but I get more comfortable every time I give it a try. 
    
    I'm consistently monitoring VE3GYQ at the moment, so if feel free to give me a call if you're in the area! I don't have a set operating schedule at the moment, but late evenings and very early mornings are usually a good bet.
    You can also reach me at my callsign at gmail.com if needed.

<h4>Two for one!</h4>

<p>
    Well, today was fun! Touched base with JO net on VE3GYQ, and was just about to turn off my radio when I heard Procom get started on VE3SUE! Still trying to get
    used to timing, I'm never sure how much space I should leave after someone unkeys their rig before I key my own (especially on a net), but also pushing past that mic fright so I can dive right in.
    
    It was really neat being able to hear from people all around Ontario, I might not have traffic for the net for a while, but I think I'll be a regular listener. I'm also looking forward
    to eventually catching Tech Net with Reg; the fact that it's a worldwide net *alone* has my interest, nevermind that it'll probably be filled with my kind of nerd.
    
    One thing I'm learning about nets is that a pen and paper are useful - but a dry erase marker and a place to use it are way more helpful and a lot less wasteful of paper.
    I've now got a notebook exclusively for radio, I've been marking down schedules, call signs, tips and tricks offered by seasoned operators, things to try... We're already up to a few pages, and I'm only just ending my second day on the air, I love this.
    
    Stay healthy, 73

<h4>Another two for one!</h4>
<p>
  Still trying to nail down a format for the blog section, and might have an idea for an interesting (I think) article or two,
  but so far the site seems to be progressing nicely. I would have missed LARC net on VE3LON yesterday, if VA3DWL hadn't reminded me. 
  I'm glad I caught it and was able to hear classmate VA3ZLS check in too. Asbolutely pog.
  <br>
  Tried to do some range testing on simplex after the LARC net last night with VA3IGT and VA3DWL, but I think we were each just beyond the usable distance from the next,
  I might have heard someone break through the squelch, but couldn't pick them up again with the squelch open.
  <br>
  I was also pleased to have a mini-ragchew with VE3EAD after the nets, he's a very friendly operator, and I hope to catch him again more often.
  If I get my workbench and task list cleared off a bit more this week, I might try to get a bit more familiar with Echolink - failing this week, there's always next...
