  I'm not sure if it's obvious from the smile on my face, but I'm riding fairly high at the moment.
  At some point, I'll stop babbling to my friends <i>about</i> radio - mostly so that I can start 
  babbling to my new friends <i>on</i> the radio.
  
  Now that I've got a paper copy of my license, I'm waiting for validation from EarthLink, and looking
  for various other ways to extend my handheld's range beyond EN92/EN93. If you've got experience
  with EarthLink (or anything related to IRLP) and you hear me on the air, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
  
  Speaking of getting on the air, VA3DWL and I are eagerly awaiting that <b>OUT FOR DELIVERY</b> message!
  If I weren't almost emitting my own RFI out of excitement, I'd almost think he's more excited than me...
  
  I'm really marvelling at the fact that this is the first hobby in which, not only have I not encountered a single
  gatekeeper, literally every person I've met just wants you to have fun and learn new things.

  I can absolutely do that.
