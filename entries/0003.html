<h4>Two for one!</h4>

    Well, today was fun! Touched base with JO net on VE3GYQ, and was just about to turn off my radio when I heard Procom get started on VE3SUE! Still trying to get
    used to timing, I'm never sure how much space I should leave after someone unkeys their rig before I key my own (especially on a net), but also pushing past that mic fright so I can dive right in.
    
    It was really neat being able to hear from people all around Ontario, I might not have traffic for the net for a while, but I think I'll be a regular listener. I'm also looking forward
    to eventually catching Tech Net with Reg; the fact that it's a worldwide net *alone* has my interest, nevermind that it'll probably be filled with my kind of nerd.
    
    One thing I'm learning about nets is that a pen and paper are useful - but a dry erase marker and a place to use it are way more helpful and a lot less wasteful of paper.
    I've now got a notebook exclusively for radio, I've been marking down schedules, call signs, tips and tricks offered by seasoned operators, things to try... We're already up to a few pages, and I'm only just ending my second day on the air, I love this.
    
    Stay healthy, 73
