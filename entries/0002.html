First off, I mentioned "Earthlink" in my first post - experienced operators probably understand that I meant "Echolink..." Either way, I'm eager to check it out.
    
    As of 2021-12-18, I am now the proud owner of a Baofeng UV-5R handheld radio, which I used to check into the local daily JO net on 2m and meet a bunch of people!
Still getting over the mic fright a little bit; I'm not usually a big talker in person, but I get more comfortable every time I give it a try. 
    
    I'm consistently monitoring VE3GYQ at the moment, so if feel free to give me a call if you're in the area! I don't have a set operating schedule at the moment, but late evenings and very early mornings are usually a good bet.
    You can also reach me at my callsign at gmail.com if needed.
